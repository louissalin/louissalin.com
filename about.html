  <p>My name is Louis Salin and I've been writing software for a living for 10 years now. I started my career in 2006 in Montreal, Canada automating the creation of 3D CAD mezzanine plans using VBA before migrating to .Net 1.0 and C#. Since then, I've gained experience in a wide array of areas from coding specific skills like Ruby on Rails and web development to business and organizing conferences. Somewhere in there I moved to Texas with my wife and had two beautiful kids.</p>

    <title>I'm a software and people person</title>
    <p>I enjoy working with people. I love sharing. I'm a team player. I'm also pretty good at being the connector between two or more separate teams. I like to make applications talk to each other. I think that's really cool! I also really enjoy the process of designing, coding, testing and improving software, although not necessarily in that order. </p>

    <title>I like to automate things</title>
    <p>I get a kick out of helping solve other people's pain points by automating tedious tasks.</p>
